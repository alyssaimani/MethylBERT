# MethylBERT
MethylBERT is an advanced prediction tool based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) specifically designed to identify arginine methylation sites in proteins. Arginine methylation is a crucial post-translational modification (PTM) process in eukaryotic cells, and understanding its regulation is vital for advancing knowledge in cellular biology and related fields. To enhance computational PTM site prediction and related studies, MethylBERT was designed as a cutting-edge arginine methylation prediction model and integrated into a user-friendly web application.
