    <p class="mt-2">
        MethylBERT is an advanced prediction tool based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) specifically designed to identify arginine methylation sites in proteins. Arginine methylation is a crucial post-translational modification (PTM) process in eukaryotic cells, and understanding its regulation is vital for advancing knowledge in cellular biology and related fields.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-2">
        To enhance computational PTM site prediction and related studies, MethylBERT was designed as a cutting-edge arginine methylation prediction model and integrated into a user-friendly web application.
